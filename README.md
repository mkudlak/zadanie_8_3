# zadanie_8_3

Task: Installation of JS-hint
Create a new repository on GitHub, name it for example "task_8_3", and clone them to yourself on the disk. Copy the package.json and .gitignore files to it from one of your previous projects. Then install all packages defined in package.json in the project using the npm install command.

Following the previous module, add the JSHint package to the test thread in the NPM scripts.

For this purpose:

install the jshint package, remembering the --save flag,
check how to call jshint - use the --help flag or documentation,
in package.json:
add task test: js, which will run jshint for all js / *. js files,
in the test test add test call test: js.
test your configuration.
If everything works correctly and the configuration of our task runner is done according to the previous module, the terminal will display the result of checking the js / *. Js files after calling any of the ticks: test: js, test and build.
